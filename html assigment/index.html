    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I am a student at Algonquin College in <em>Interactive Media Design</em>. 
        I started my program on January 12<sup>th</sup>. I am a creative and motivated 
        student who has a strong interest in photography and media. I enjoy capturing 
        moments through my camera and expressing ideas visually. Photography allows me 
        to tell stories in my own way, and I am always looking to improve my skills by 
        learning new techniques and exploring different styles. My passion for creativity 
        pushed me to study web development so I can combine visuals with technology.

    <p>
        I chose to study <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> because I want 
        to create websites that are both functional and visually appealing. Learning HTML 
        is my first step in this journey, and I am excited to keep building my knowledge. 
        I believe that consistency and practice<sup>1</sup> are the keys to success. 
        I stay motivated by reminding myself to keep going even when things feel challenging.

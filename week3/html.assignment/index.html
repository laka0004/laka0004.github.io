        I chose to study <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> because I want to create websites 
                that are both functional and visually appealing. Learning HTML is my first step in this journey, and 
                I am excited to keep building my knowledge. I believe that consistency and practice<sup>1</sup> are 
                the keys to success. I stay motivated by reminding myself to keep going even when things feel challenging.
